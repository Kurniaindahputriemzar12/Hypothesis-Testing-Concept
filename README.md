INTRODUCTION
Hypothesis testing concept in R programming is a process of testing the hypothesis made by the researcher or to validate the hypothesis. To perform hypothesis testing, a random sample of data from the population is taken and testing is performed. Based on the results of testing, the hypothesis is either selected or rejected. This concept is known as Statistical Inference.  

Hypothesis Testing in R
Statisticians use hypothesis testing to formally check whether the hypothesis is accepted or rejected. Hypothesis testing is conducted in the following manner:

1. State the Hypotheses – Stating the null and alternative hypotheses.
2. Formulate an Analysis Plan – The formulation of an analysis plan is a crucial step in this stage.
3. Analyze Sample Data – Calculation and interpretation of the test statistic, as described in the analysis plan.
4. Interpret Results – Application of the decision rule described in the analysis plan.

Hypothesis testing ultimately uses a p-value to weigh the strength of the evidence or in other words what the data are about the population. The p-value ranges between 0 and 1. It can be interpreted in the following way:

- A small p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject it.
- A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject it.
- A p-value very close to the cutoff (0.05) is considered to be marginal and could go either way.
